This project demonstrates how to use an IR sensor module with an LED controlled by an Arduino board. 
The IR sensor module is connected to pin 6 of the Arduino board, and an LED is connected to pin 5. 
When an object is detected by the IR sensor, the LED lights up.

*Components Required
  Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
  IR sensor module
  LED
  Resistors (if needed for the LED)
  Breadboard and jumper wires

*Connections:

  1. Connect the VCC and GND of the IR sensor module to 5V and GND of the Arduino, respectively.
  2. Connect the OUT pin of the IR sensor module to digital pin 6 on the Arduino.
  3. Connect the anode (+) of the LED through a current-limiting resistor (if necessary) to digital pin 5 of the Arduino.
  4. Connect the cathode (-) of the LED to GND.

 *Uploading the Code
  1. Connect your Arduino: Use the USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
  2. Select your board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino board. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the correct port for your Arduino.
  3. Upload the code: Click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

*Testing:
  Power up the Arduino board.
  Place an object in front of the IR sensor module.
  Observe that the LED connected to pin 5 lights up when the IR sensor detects an object.

*Usage
  This project can be used as a simple demonstration of how to interface an IR sensor module with an Arduino for object detection, with the LED providing a visual indicator.
